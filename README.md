# reBAND-2.0
An extension of my summative assignment for grade 10 Technological Design. The reBAND is a gyroscopic headset that allows people with neck and spine problems to exercise and rehabilitate without the fear of causing further damage to their spine and neck. The goal of reBAND 2.0 is to make the design less bulky than the original and pair the device with an android app which will track their progress, help set goals, and send daily exercise reminders.
